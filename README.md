# Maze - Game
🧩 Maze Game (JavaScript Canvas Project)

This project is an interactive Maze Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the player navigates through a randomly generated maze to reach the destination. The game uses the HTML5 Canvas for rendering the maze and player movements in real time.

The maze is generated dynamically using a Depth-First Search (DFS) backtracking algorithm, ensuring that each playthrough creates a unique and solvable maze. Players control a ball using keyboard arrow keys and must find the correct path from the start point to the end point.
